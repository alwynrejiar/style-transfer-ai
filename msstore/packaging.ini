[signing]
; For MS Store submission you do NOT sign the MSIX yourself —
; Microsoft signs it during the submission pipeline.
; For sideloading/testing, use a self-signed certificate:
;   New-SelfSignedCertificate -Subject "CN=YourPublisherId" -Type CodeSigningCert -CertStoreLocation "Cert:\CurrentUser\My"
; Then export the .pfx and reference it here:
; certificate = certs\test_signing.pfx
; password = your_password
